    <h2>Inflation</h2>
    <p>
      Many have heard on any outlet of media that inflation is on the rise.
      Taken from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (<a
        href="url">https://www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/supplemental-files/</a>), this dataset documents
      the increase of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) all the way from the 1920s to current day.
      The CPI indicates the price of a weight average market basket of consumer goods and services purchased by
      househols.
      This first visualization is to visualize for you how fast the CPI has been increasing as it approaches current day.
      Despite economic pressures, consumers still spend on leisure. Here, we compare CPI trends with video game sales.
      How does this spending compare to what someone earns weekly?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br>
      <br>
      With this in mind, you can interactively explore in this section how increasing CPI, which correlates with
      increasing inflation, affects
      the purchase of goods outside of what is considered in CPI; Video Games!

    <h2>How Does Inflation Affect Household Income?</h2>
    <p>
      By visualizing the relationships between household income, age, household size, and inflation rates, we can
      better understand how inflation impacts different demographics. This scatterplot will help you see whether modern
      income levels are sufficient to maintain a good quality of life.

    <h2>How Much Do People Really Earn?</h2>
    <p>
      Over the years, inflation has eroded the purchasing power of weekly earnings for the average worker.
      Let's start by examining the trends in weekly real earnings and how they compare to inflation.

    <h2>Shifting Priorities in Spending</h2>
    <p>
      Inflation has not only influenced major prices across the board, but has also influenced
      how we allocate money on non-essentials as well! Using this dataset, (<a
            href="url">https://store.nba.com/jerseys/</a>), the pie chart highlights how spending
      wages on regular items such as NBA merchandise has evolved during inflationary periods.
      Examining inflation's impact on retail jersey prices from 2005 to 2025,
      the pie chart illustrates the toll inflation has taken on Sports merchandise and it's average price.
